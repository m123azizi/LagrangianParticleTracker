# Real-Time Volumetric Particle Tracking (VPTV)

This repository hosts the code for a real-time, high-fidelity, volumetric 3D particle tracking system designed for capturing Lagrangian trajectories in turbulent or volumetric flows. The system integrates GPU acceleration (CUDA), a Qt-based GUI, and a synchronized multi-camera imaging setup to reconstruct particle positions in three dimensions with extensive visualization and data handling features.
